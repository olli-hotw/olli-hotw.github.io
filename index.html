    <h3>Course Description</h3>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web is a vast and diverse space. Since its inception in the early 1990s, it has grown to
        include an estimated 2 billion websites containing 7,500 terabytes of information. Today, approximately 5
        billion people spend about 6 1/2 hours accessing the web daily. We routinely use the web to communicate,
        collaborate, access information, shop, manage our finances and entertain ourselves. This course is designed
        to enhance studentsâ€™ understanding of technologies enabling the web in ways that help us better navigate it.
        We will review the history of the web and key ideologies that influence its design. With this framework in
        hand, we will explore the web in more depth, covering social media, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence,
        cybersecurity and the dark web. While this lecture-based course will explore some case studies, students can
        expect to participate in lively discussions about the web's social and cultural impacts.
